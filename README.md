# AI API sample

Simple sample for sending prompts to

- Gemini
- Claude
- OpenAI

Generated with Windsurf IDE and Claude with a simple [prompt](ai.md),

As of 2024-12-26 the Gemini sample works instantly with a free account and a API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey. Now I will add a little intelligence to my apps;-)

```
> composer install
```
